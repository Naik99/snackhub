## **Usage**
### **HTML Structure**
The section is structured using semantic HTML with Tailwind CSS classes. Each recipe is wrapped in a card component.

```html
<div class="flex-none snap-center w-full lg:w-1/3 bg-white shadow-2xl rounded-lg transform transition duration-500 hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-xl">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" 
       alt="Cookies Recipe" 
       class="rounded-t-lg w-full h-48 object-cover">
  <div class="p-6">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 animate-fade-in-down">Top 5 Recipes with Cookies</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in-right">
      Learn how to turn your cookies into delicious crumble milkshakes, desserts, and more. Perfect for every occasion!
    </p>
    <a href="#" class="mt-4 inline-block text-pink-600 font-bold hover:underline">Read More</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **Animation Setup**
Animations like "fade-in" or "hover effects" are defined using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Additional animation classes can be added with frameworks like [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) or custom CSS.

## **Customization**
### **Tailwind Configuration**
Modify Tailwind CSS classes to adjust styles, animations, or layouts:
- **Image Sizes**: Use `w-*` and `h-*` classes for custom dimensions.
- **Card Layout**: Adjust `lg:w-1/3` for the number of cards displayed per row.
- **Animations**: Customize animation effects via Tailwind or external libraries.
